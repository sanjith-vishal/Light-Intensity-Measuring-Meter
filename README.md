# Light-Intensity-Measuring-Meter
Light Intensity Measuring Meter: A light measuring meter is a digital device that measures the intensity of light. It finds applications in schools, hospitals, production areas, and passageways to measure and maintain proper lighting levels. Photographers often use it to determine the proper exposure for a photograph. This project uses the BH1750FVI sensor to measure the ambient lighting level. BH1750FVI is a calibrated digital light sensor IC that measures the incident light intensity and converts it into a 16-bit digital number. It can measure ambient light intensity ranging from 0 to 65535 Lux (L). The Lux is an SI unit for illuminance, equal to one lumen per square meter. The BH1750FVI sensor directly gives output in Lux. The spectral response function of the sensor is approximately close to that of the human eye. The BH1750FVI sensor measures the light's analog values, and the information is sent to the ATmega 328, which then displays the value in the LCD, which has been interfaced with the microcontroller.
